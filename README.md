# Police Statements

View the project [here](http://interpolack.github.io/policestatements).

The Los Angeles Police Department operates a Twitter account (@LAPDHQ) that posts information about current events related to crime in Los Angeles and LAPD public affairs. Among this information includes reports of "Officer-Involved Shootings" (OIS), which refer to incidents where police officers use a firearm against a criminal suspect. Curiously, not all Officer-Involved Shootings are reported via Twitter, and of those that are, they may not be described as such. The purpose of this project is to provide documentation of Officer-Involved Shootings alongside the corresponding accounts of these events that the LAPD publishes to its Twitter audience. In doing so, the project aims to indicate how the LAPD's documentation of Officer-Involved Shootings involves editorial decisions about what information is made public, and through which channels.
